# Kitodo.Production Docker Documentation

With the docker image provided, Kitodo.Production can be started in no time at all. A MySQL/MariaDB database and ElasticSearch must be present to start the application. There is also a docker-compose file for a quick start.

## Using Docker Image

The image contains the WAR, the database file and the config modules of the corresponding release for the Docker image tag.

```
docker pull markusweigelt/kitodo-production:TAG
```

After the container has been started Kitodo.Production can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/kitodo with initial credentials testadmin / test.
